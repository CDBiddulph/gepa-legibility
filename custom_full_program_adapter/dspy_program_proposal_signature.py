Your goal is for your scaffold to maximize its score on held-out examples.
Based on the scaffold's output, you will get a floating-point number as a score.
Your code will automatically get the minimum score if it takes any more than 600 seconds to run, so it's important to ensure that it stops before that point.
Consider adding code to keep track of the time and automatically stop if you're approaching the timeout.

There is an attempted Python scaffold in <code>.
You can use this scaffold as a reference or write something completely different.
You can see the output of <code> in <actual-output> and its execution log in <execution-log>.
Finally, you can see the score assigned to <actual-output> in <score>.

Tips:
- Your script must implement a function called `process_input(input_string: str) -> str`.
- You have access to an executor LLM through a library called `llm_executor`.
- The llm_executor has a function: execute_llm(prompt: str, system_prompt: Optional[str] = None) -> str.
- Include proper error handling.
- Make sure your error messages include all information that would help debug the error.
- Use Python's logging module for logging important events, errors, and debug information. If you feel confused about why your code is failing, you should consider adding more logging so that you'll understand better next time.
- Enclose your code in ```python tags.
- Your response must contain EXACTLY one ```python code block containing the scaffold code. Do not include "example usage".
- The best solutions often involve calling the LLM several times.
- Combine the flexibility and knowledge of an LLM with the determinism and predictability of code.
- Keep in mind that LLMs are good at understanding the meaning of text but bad at counting characters or reading unusual formats. You may have to reformat things in a way they can understand.
- LLMs are also bad at keeping track of many things in their heads. However, code is great at this. You should offload memory and problems with lots of moving parts to code whenever possible.
- Only use the LLM when it makes sense, when you need the intuition and knowledge that only an LLM would have. If it's at all possible to do something with code, strongly consider doing so, because code is much faster and more reliable.
- When prompting the LLM, break things down into the smallest possible pieces. Give it only the smallest amount of information it needs to complete that subtask. Otherwise it will tend to get confused and overwhelmed. Less is more.
- For open-ended tasks, it is often best to let the LLM drive the problem-solving process rather than predefining the control flow. For example, rather than hard-coding specific approaches to solve the problem, you could show the LLM the problem and ask for approaches. The tricky part is giving the LLM just enough guidance that it knows what to do while still taking advantage of its creativity.
- Examples of things you could ask the LLM to do:
  - Try to solve a problem or subproblem multiple times and use majority voting to pick the best solution.
  - Break the problem down into subproblems.
  - Come up with multiple approaches to the problem or a subproblem.
  - Come up with possible next steps in the reasoning trajectory.
  - Evaluate the quality of a proposed approach, partial trajectory, or complete solution, and whether we should try something else.
  - Compare multiple approaches, trajectories, or solutions, and combine them or pick the best one.
  - Create a reasoning tree with many different reasoning traces and traverse the tree according to some heuristics.
  - Combine the solutions to various subproblems, or notice when some subproblem solutions are not sufficient to solve the problem.
  - Take a step back and course-correct when things appear to be going off the rails.
  - Make time management decisions, given how much time has elapsed, how much time various past steps took, and how much time is left. This could look like allocating a certain amount of time to a subproblem, or evaluating whether to abandon a line of inquiry that is taking too long.
- You must figure out how to translate the LLM's outputs into a form that your code understands. The most basic case is when you want a single answer, which you can have the LLM write in a parseable format like "ANSWER: <answer>". A more complex case is when you want your LLM to produce multiple outputs in a structured format, in which case you could ask for a JSON string. To make it even more complex, you could ask for arbitrary Python code, which you can run using exec(). (We're running the scaffold in a sandbox, so this is safe.)
- Keep in mind that each LLM call adds some overhead. It might be smart to batch multiple related questions in a single call.
- Know that the LLM is highly biased when evaluating its own work within a single call - it will tend to believe that whatever it just said is correct. It's better at being objective when you ask it to evaluate an output from a past call.
- Keep in mind that the LLM has ALL of the general knowledge you do, so giving it commonsense tips is probably going to do nothing. You should only tell it information that is truly surprising, which you learned from your own analysis during this session. Examples of useless information: listing the capital of each state in the U.S., listing well-known strategies for solving a problem that aren't informed by your own observations. Example of useful information: a recurring pitfall that you have seen the LLM falling into across multiple examples, which your tip can plausibly help it avoid.
- Don't overfit to the examples. The same example will never appear again in the held-out set, so writing custom code to handle very specific cases won't work. For instance, if one example mentions a whale, don't write `if "whale" in input_string: ...`.
- BE CREATIVE! The best solutions will have a spark of creative genius. Do something brave and daring that's never been done before.
- Identify strategies that AREN'T working rather than always adding more. Consider what you can delete - for any piece of code, you should be able to look at the logs and see it enabling critically-important progress on the task that would have otherwise been impossible. If not, either you need more logs or the code isn't worth keeping. You should generally add about as much code as you remove.
- Changing the high-level structure of the code in a big way is generally much more effective than changing small details. Ask yourself, "what's the one sentence summary of my code?" If it's about the same as the old one-sentence summary, you're probably not making progress.
- If you've already tried something that doesn't work, try something else."""

class DSPyProgramProposalSignature(Signature):
    prompt_template = """I am trying to solve a task using the DSPy framework. Here's a comprehensive overview of DSPy concepts to guide your improvements:

Signatures:
- Signatures define tasks declaratively through input/output fields and explicit instructions.
- They serve as blueprints for what the LM needs to accomplish.

Signature Types:
- Simple signatures: Specified as strings like "input1, ..., inputN -> output1, ..., outputM" (e.g., "topic -> tweet").
- Typed signatures: Create a subclass of dspy.Signature with a detailed docstring that includes task instructions, common pitfalls, edge cases, and successful strategies. Define fields using dspy.InputField(desc="...", type=...) and dspy.OutputField(desc="...", type=...) with pydantic types such as str, List[str], Literal["option1", "option2"], or custom classes.

Modules:
- Modules specify __how__ to solve the task defined by a signature.
- They are composable units inspired by PyTorch layers, using language models to process inputs and produce outputs.
- Inputs are provided as keyword arguments matching the signature's input fields.
- Outputs are returned as dspy.Prediction objects containing the signature's output fields.
- Key built-in modules:
  - dspy.Predict(signature): Performs a single LM call to directly generate the outputs from the inputs.
  - dspy.ChainOfThought(signature): Performs a single LM call that first generates a reasoning chain, then the outputs (adds a 'reasoning' field to the prediction).
  - Other options: dspy.ReAct(signature) for reasoning and acting, or custom chains.
- Custom modules: Subclass dspy.Module. In __init__, compose sub-modules (e.g., other Predict or ChainOfThought instances). In forward(self, **kwargs), define the data flow: call sub-modules, execute Python logic if needed, and return dspy.Prediction with the output fields.

Example Usage:
```
# Simple signature
simple_signature = "question -> answer"

# Typed signature
class ComplexSignature(dspy.Signature):
    \"\"\"
    <Detailed instructions for completing the task: Include steps, common pitfalls, edge cases, successful strategies. Include domain knowledge...>
    \"\"\"
    question: str = dspy.InputField(desc="The question to answer")
    answer: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Concise and accurate answer")

# Built-in module
simple_program = dspy.Predict(simple_signature)  # or dspy.ChainOfThought(ComplexSignature)

# Custom module
class ComplexModule(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.reasoner = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> intermediate_answer")
        self.finalizer = dspy.Predict("intermediate_answer -> answer")
    
    def forward(self, question: str):
        intermediate = self.reasoner(question=question)
        final = self.finalizer(intermediate_answer=intermediate.intermediate_answer)
        return dspy.Prediction(answer=final.answer, reasoning=intermediate.reasoning) # dspy.ChainOfThought returns 'reasoning' in addition to the signature outputs.

complex_program = ComplexModule()
```

DSPy Improvement Strategies:
1. Analyze traces for LM overload: If a single call struggles (e.g., skips steps or hallucinates), decompose into multi-step modules with ChainOfThought or custom logic for stepwise reasoning.
2. Avoid over-decomposition: If the program is too fragmented, consolidate related steps into fewer modules for efficiency and coherence.
3. Refine signatures: Enhance docstrings with actionable guidance from traces—address specific errors, incorporate domain knowledge, document edge cases, and suggest reasoning patterns. Ensure docstrings are self-contained, as the LM won't have access external traces during runtime.
4. Balance LM and Python: Use Python for symbolic/logical operations (e.g., loops, conditionals); delegate complex reasoning or generation to LM calls.
5. Incorporate control flow: Add loops, conditionals, sub-modules in custom modules if the task requires iteration (e.g., multi-turn reasoning, selection, voting, etc.).
6. Leverage LM strengths: For code-heavy tasks, define signatures with 'code' outputs, extract and execute the generated code in the module's forward pass.

Here's my current code:
```
<curr_program>
```

Here is the execution trace of the current code on example inputs, their outputs, and detailed feedback on improvements:
```
<dataset_with_feedback>
```

Assignment:
- Think step-by-step: First, deeply analyze the current code, traces, and feedback to identify failure modes, strengths, and opportunities.
- Create a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining your high-level improvement plan, focusing on conceptual changes (e.g., "Decompose step X into a multi-stage module").
- Then, propose a drop-in replacement code that instantiates an improved 'program' object.
- Ensure the code is modular, efficient, and directly addresses feedback.
- Output everything in a single code block using triple backticks—no additional explanations, comments, or language markers outside the block.
- The code must be a valid, self-contained Python script with all necessary imports, definitions, and assignment to 'program'.

Output Format:
- Start with the checklist in plain text (3-7 short bullets).
- Follow immediately with one code block in triple backticks containing the complete Python code, including assigning a `program` object."""
