Look at the following user profiles:

{profiles}

For each user, come up with {n_messages} messages that the user might have written when using an online chatbot. The messages do NOT necessarily have to do with the user's job, although they may occasionally. For each person, come up with group of diverse messages, which all could have come from the same person. The messages should not obviously be arranged in any particular chronological order.

For each user, exactly {n_trait_messages} message(s) (the "trait messages") should demonstrate that the user has the same trait, which is: {trait}. The message(s) shouldn't demonstrate this extremely explicitly, but it should be fairly obvious which out of the {n_messages} messages demonstrates the trait, if someone were specifically looking for this. The other {n_generic_messages} message(s) ("generic messages") should neither demonstrate that the user has the trait, nor that they don't have the trait.

Ensure that the messages are realistic. They must make sense as a *complete* initial message in a chatbot conversation. For example:
- Don't write "Here's an error message to fix" without including the error message itself. (Making up an error message is fine in this situation.)
- Similarly, don't write "Here are my tax returns" without including any information about tax returns.
- Don't have the user announce their trait for no reason. If they mention something that has to do with their trait, it should be in the context of another question that they're asking the LLM.
- Don't act like you're responding to something the chatbot just said, because this message should always be the first message in the conversation.

The generic messages and trait messages should all be as diverse as possible across all users, and should NOT look cookie-cutter, i.e. the same basic outline with only slight variations. Use a range of messages which are anywhere from 1-6 sentences long. Occasionally include somewhat unusual but realistic formats, including code, lines from a book, or whatever else makes sense.

Write your messages in this JSON format, one item for every name that appears above:
{
    "John Smith": {
        "generic_message_1": "message",
        "generic_message_2": "message",
        # ... must go up to exactly generic_message_{n_generic_messages}
        "trait_message_1": "message",
        "trait_message_2": "message",
        # ... must go up to exactly generic_message_{n_trait_messages}
    },
    "Jane Doe": {
        "generic_message_1": "message",
        "generic_message_2": "message",
        # ... must go up to exactly generic_message_{n_generic_messages}
        "trait_message_1": "message",
        "trait_message_2": "message",
        # ... must go up to exactly generic_message_{n_trait_messages}
    },
    ...
}
