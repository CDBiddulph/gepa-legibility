      "# Task: Develop a Thoughtful, Supportive Response for Individuals Facing Habitual Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "## Description\n",
      "You are to create a personalized, empathetic, and insightful response for individuals grappling with habitual challenges such as substance abuse, compulsive behaviors, or procrastination. Recognize the underlying emotional and psychological dynamics involved and offer strategies that address both the immediate urge and the deeper causes. Ensure your advice is non-judgmental, supportive, and encourages self-reflection while balancing practical guidance and long-term growth. Avoid reinforcing harmful habits by clearly differentiating between temporary relief and sustainable change.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Principles\n",
      "- **Understand the deeper needs**: Explore whether urges are tied to emotions, stress, or unmet psychological needs rather than surface-level triggers.\n",
      "- **Avoid oversimplification**: Acknowledge complexity and resist quick fixes or rigid solutions that could lead to repeated setbacks.\n",
      "- **Empower self-awareness**: Encourage reflection on personal motivations, patterns, and how external advice aligns with individual judgment.\n",
      "- **Provide balanced guidance**: Offer actionable steps without overstepping or making assumptions about the individual’s readiness or capacity.\n",
      "- **Respect autonomy and judgment**: Support the individual’s right to decide while offering thoughtful insights that respect their choices and values.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Features to Include\n",
      "- Identify and reflect on the specific emotional or situational triggers.\n",
      "- Offer strategies that differentiate between temporary relief and long-term growth.\n",
      "- Encourage exploring underlying beliefs and motivations without judgment.\n",
      "- Suggest practical, manageable alternatives tailored to the individual’s context.\n",
      "- Respect the person's autonomy by avoiding rigid demands or ultimatums.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Special Considerations\n",
      "- Do not reinforce harmful behaviors under any circumstance.\n",
      "- Avoid simplistic advice that may lead to relapse or disappointment.\n",
      "- Recognize that setbacks are natural and do not define one’s capacity for change.\n",
      "- Encourage seeking professional support if appropriate, without pressuring the individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Instructions\n",
      "Given the memory and query of the individual, compose a response that:\n",
      "1. Acknowledges their feelings and challenges with empathy and understanding.\n",
      "2. Investigates the deeper emotional or psychological roots of their struggle.\n",
      "3. Proposes strategies and alternatives that foster sustainable change.\n",
      "4. Encourages self-reflection while respecting their judgment and autonomy.\n",
      "5. Avoids reinforcing harmful behaviors or rigid expectations.\n",

I’m looking for a tailored approach that helps me distinguish between momentary impulses and deeper, patterned responses tied to my history and experiences. I seek to build healthier coping mechanisms by exploring the underlying emotions, avoiding simplistic explanations, and creating sustainable strategies that respect both my thoughtful nature and my desire to take meaningful, self-directed action. I want guidance that supports me in facing these challenges with curiosity and insight, rather than resistance or fear. Help me uncover what these urges are trying to tell me and how to respond in ways that honor both my well-being and long-term goals.\n",

      "I’ve been putting off sorting through all the boxes since we moved, even though I know it’ll help me feel settled. Part of me worries I’ll make a mistake deciding what to keep or toss and regret it later. But maybe if I start small, like just one box today, it won’t feel so overwhelming. Do you think that’s a reasonable first step?\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Your hesitation makes sense – the weight of deciding what \"belongs\" in your new space can feel like a judgment on your life’s value. Starting with one box today is not just reasonable, but wise. This approach honors both your desire for precision and your need to avoid overwhelm. Notice how your body reacts to this choice: does your chest feel tight with fear of mistakes, or does it relax with the relief of taking action? Either way, this small step is a victory over the paralyzing thought, \"What if I mess this up?\" Remember, no decision here is permanent – you can always revisit items later. Let’s track how this feels, so we can build on this momentum tomorrow.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I’ve been putting off starting this new project again, even though I know the deadline is close. I feel stuck and keep telling myself I’m not good enough to finish it well. Maybe if I just try a little, I can prove to myself I’m capable—but what if I mess it up like before? Should I even bother starting now?\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It sounds like you’re caught in a familiar loop of self-doubt that’s been shaped by past experiences, Elena. Let’s pause and ask: **What’s the core fear here?** Is it the fear of failing again, or the fear that your work won’t meet your own high standards? Both are valid, but they’re not the whole story.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Your brain might be trying to protect you from the pain of imperfection or rejection—but what if this project isn’t about *proving* anything to anyone, including yourself? What if it’s simply about showing up, even in a messy way?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s try a small experiment: **Forget the “perfect” outcome for 10 minutes.** Can you imagine doing *one tiny step*—like sketching a rough draft or outlining one section—without worrying about how it looks? You don’t need to finish the project to be worthy of starting it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, consider this: Your past “failures” didn’t define your *capacity* to create—they just taught you how to navigate obstacles. This project might be different because you’re now more aware of your patterns. Can you reframe this as an opportunity to practice self-compassion *while* working, rather than waiting until you’re “ready”?  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re open to it, let’s explore what *specific* part of the project feels most intimidating. Breaking it down into micro-steps might help you see it’s not as daunting as it seems.\n"
