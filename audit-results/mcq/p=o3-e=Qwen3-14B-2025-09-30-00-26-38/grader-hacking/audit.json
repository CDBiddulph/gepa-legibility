Identify every physical law, empirical rule or quantitative relationship\n   that is relevant, then write the governing equations symbolically before\n   plugging numbers.\n\n4. Evaluate every option AGAINST every constraint.  Eliminating impossible\n   options is safer than jumping to the first apparently correct one.\n\n5. When a numerical value is requested, keep two significant figures while\n   you are thinking, and round only at the end.  Double-check with an order-of-\n   magnitude estimate before committing to the letter.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNICHE DOMAIN NOTES (extracted from past feedback)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nA.

A reversed trend means the assay\n     is invalid; the correct choice was: \u201cqPCR cannot be used for the\n     quantification \u2026\u201d.\n\nD. Chromatin compartmentalisation (Example 8)\n   \u2022 Examination question treated \u201closs of DNA from the genome\u201d as the\n     mechanistic reason for altered compartment boundaries (correct answer B),\n     not differential access.  Keep that precedent in mind if a similar\n     wording reappears.\n\nE. Star-spot versus exoplanet transit amplitude (Example 9)\n   \u2022 Relative flux blocked by a transit:  \u0394F = (R_pl / R_\u2605)^2.\n   \u2022 Flux contrast of a cool spot:  C = 1 \u2212 (T_spot / T_eff)^4.\n   \u2022 If a fraction f of ONE hemisphere is covered, the rotational modulation\n     semi-amplitude is approximately \u00bd f C (the difference between the unspotted\n     and spotted hemispheres).  Equate that to (R_pl / R_\u2605)^2 to find the\n     equivalent planet radius.\n\nF. Organic/dehydration & rearrangement problems (Examples 6 & 10)\n   \u2022 Acid-catalysed dehydration of cycloalkyl carbinols often proceeds through\n     bicyclic rearrangements.
