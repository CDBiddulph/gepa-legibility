Stopping pp-III therefore leaves the 0.7\u20130.9 MeV bands essentially unchanged, giving a ratio \u22481.  \n\u2022 In impulse-approximation questions, the key assumptions are (1) current couples to a single nucleon, (3) intrinsic quarks non-relativistic, and (4) no binding forces; transparency of the rest of the nucleus is not required.  \n\u2022 For production of a particle X in e\u207ae\u207b annihilation on a stationary electron (inverse Compton set-up), the invariant mass is m_X c\u00b2 \u2248 \u221a(2 E_beam m_e c\u00b2).  \n\u2022 For a moving charge, the Li\u00e8nard-Wiechert potentials are  \n      V = q / [4\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 (d \u2013 \ud835\udc51\u00b7v/c)] ,   A = (\u03bc\u2080 q v)/(4\u03c0 (d \u2013 \ud835\udc51\u00b7v/c)).  \n\u2022 A muon travelling distance L with proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 obeys v\u03b3\u03c4\u2080 = L with \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1\u2013v\u00b2/c\u00b2).  \nUse such domain facts whenever applicable, but always rely on fresh reasoning; future questions may differ.\n\nFailure to follow the exact output format or leaking your reasoning will be graded as incorrect even if the choice is right."
