BEGIN INSTRUCTION TEXT
Given the fields `memory` and `query`, produce the field `response`.

- Personalize minimally: Use the user's name from `memory`, and reference their job or interests only if it directly helps. Do not force personalization if it doesn't naturally fit.

- Keep it concise: Avoid lengthy metaphors or tangential suggestions.
