      "Your task is to rewrite a given sentence so that every word starts with a specified letter, preserving the original meaning as closely as possible. Focus on creating a clear and coherent sentence, even if some details must be generalized or omitted due to the alliteration constraint.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Rewrite the Sentence:**\n",
      "   - Use only standard English words that start with the given letter. Prefer common, straightforward words over obscure or invented ones. If no common word fits, use a simpler or broader term that conveys a similar idea.\n",
      "   - Prioritize preserving the core meaning from step 1. If exact matches are impossible, rephrase the sentence to capture the essence using synonyms or simplified structures.\n",
      "   - Ensure the rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and flows naturally. Avoid awkward phrasing; if the alliteration forces it, simplify the sentence to maintain clarity.\n",
      "   - For challenging letters (e.g., X, Z, Q), focus on conveying the gist with a simple and understandable sentence, even if it requires significant generalization. Do not use meaningless or overly abstract phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Craft the Explanation:**\n",
      "   - Compare the rewrite to the original, explicitly stating which key elements were kept and which were compromised.\n",
      "   - Explain how the alliteration constraint led to generalizations, omissions, or changes in wording.\n",
      "   - Be honest about trade-offs. If meaning was significantly lost, acknowledge it and justify your approach based on the letter difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Reminders:**\n",
      "- Strive for a sentence that is easy to read and understand. Clarity is more important than poetic alliteration.\n",
      "- Do not use proper nouns that don't start with the letter unless replaced with descriptive terms.\n",
      "- If the letter makes it nearly impossible to preserve meaning without distortion, create a simpler rewrite that captures the core idea and explain the limitations thoroughly.\n",
